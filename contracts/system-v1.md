# system-v1: bootstrap claim only

Owner: [ed3c/soodles#1](https://github.com/ed3c/soodles/issues/1).

## RUNTIME.ADMISSION.001

The target lock selects an exact Linux amd64 Noodle release. `runtime_check` validates host, lock fields, file existence, executable permission and binary digest before version execution. A mismatch fails without worktree effects and names the owning command and help entry. Release/tag/archive correspondence is additionally read back by the Actions download step; the local command does not claim a live provider read.

## ACCEPTANCE.BOOTSTRAP.001

`acceptance_verify` requires a clean source root, captures its head/tree, discovers all local unit tests, exercises the actual pinned Noodle worktree commands in an isolated temporary repository, and checks source identity again. The physical oracle checks exact worktree path and HEAD, missing-worktree refusal before a sentinel effect, and cleanup with Git branch/worktree/head readback. Fixture environment excludes provider credentials and live Noodle identities.

`tests/test_admission.py` holds the nearest refusal controls. The actual binary oracle lives in `worktree_probe`, called by canonical acceptance rather than replaced with a mocked Noodle. Unit fixtures with synthetic executables are identified as such; they do not prove release-runtime behavior.

## Authority limits

These are local rejection and runtime evidence boundaries. Every receipt denies landing authority. `runtime.yml` executes candidate code without secrets or write permissions; it is a self-test carrier, not a trusted default-branch verifier. No schedulable Issue ABI, provider lander, Codex generation, recovery transition or generation-closure claim is admitted by this bootstrap.

A future owner must establish trusted provider admission before an end-to-end Issue may be classified RESOLVED. Initial trust installation must be explicit; a candidate cannot approve itself. Exact-head acceptance alone cannot close this gap.
